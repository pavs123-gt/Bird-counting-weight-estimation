# 🐔 Bird Counting and Weight Estimation from CCTV Video

A complete computer vision pipeline for **poultry bird counting and video-based weight estimation** using fixed-camera CCTV footage.  
The system takes a poultry CCTV video as input, detects and tracks birds over time, estimates bird counts, computes a **relative weight proxy**, and generates annotated video outputs.  
A **FastAPI service** is provided for easy video analysis through an API.
